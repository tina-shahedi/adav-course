## Final Group Assignment

In this last part of group assignment, you will design and build an RShiny Application, using the work you did in part 1 of group assignment. The purpose of the shiny app is to visualize and provide analytical output for a dataset of your choice (see below), using appropriate visualization and analysis methods covered in this course. The RShiny Application should be a stand-alone application. That is, the user should be able to understand its purpose and outcomes from just the application (so without requiring any additional explanation outside of the application).

For this part of the assignment, please continue working on the dataset you chose for part 1 of the group assignment, which can still be found [here](https://tshahedi.github.io/adav-course/files/datasets-assignment-1stGA.zip). A brief outline is repeated below. Each of these datasets has a large number of variables, and it is up to you which variables you will use/not use within your visualization and analysis process. Note that if you would like to adjust the variables you use in the final assignment compared to part 1, you can do so.

The deadline for handing in the full group assignment is on **June 10th (end of the day)**. The assignment should be uploaded on Black Board as a zip file, which contains the following:

- a .Rproj file;
- the raw shiny files (ui.R/server.R);
- if appropriate, a separate data preprocessing file (.Rmd).

**At the bottom of the assignment, please include a sentence stating each studentâ€™s contribution towards the end product (e.g., which student completed what tasks). Please also mention whether you used any AI tool or not; in case you did use, mention which one and how did you use it**. For collaborative efforts, tasks can be repeated over multiple students. In the extreme case of very diverging unique contributions, the coordinator has the possibility to differentiate the grading over students within a group.

### Step 1:

Review your steps done in part 1 of your group assignment: the selected dataset and variables within the dataset, and the analysis done and visualizations chosen.

### Step 2:

Set up your Shiny application, which includes a title and one or two lines containing the purpose of your application. Your application will use at least three and at maximum six interactive components (such as Checkboxes, Sliders, Select Boxes, etc...).

### Step 3:

Produce an interactive visualization of your data. Use (a selection of) the visualizations you made during part 1 of the assignment as a basis to extend to an interactive visualization. You are of course allowed to improve visualizations made during part 1 in any way, or make completely new ones if you want. In total, use a maximum of two plots to visualize your data and analysis results (see step 4).

### Step 4:

Integrate the statistical method chosen during part 1 into your application. If you want, you can modify or change the statistical method chosen before. Make sure that the application has an added value in terms of the analysis done. For example:

- Use the application to compare the performance of different statistical methods on predicting an outcome in your dataset.
- Use the application to show the process of tuning a parameter of a statistical method.

In addition, make sure the statistical method applied includes an interactive component. Visualize (part of) your analysis results as part of your first interactive visualization or as a second (interactive) visualization.

### Step 5:

At the bottom of the application, include an interpretation of the analysis results that includes a reactive component. This can either consist of a reactive text or a fixed line of text combined with a reactive table providing the exact analysis results. Note: a reactive component is not an interactive component, and thus does not count for the min. 3 and max. 6 interactive components.

### Step 6:

Present your application, as both a completed application (ui.R/server.R) in addition to well-documented support files, so that it can be understood the steps you have taken both inside and outside (e.g., data preparation) of the RShiny Application to create and present this application.

### Notes:

The following should be noted:

- Attempting to use too much information in a plot is as bad as not using enough information, so use your judgment to decide how to use the Shiny functions to your advantage to display the data in the most appropriate way.
- You are welcome to provide a separate data preprocessing file (.Rmd), if you would prefer.
- Since you will be using real-world datasets, there is likely to be some missing data; it is up to you how you would like to manage this.
- Making the assignment alone is not allowed. Students have to stay in their assigned groups.

### Grading:

Your grade will be determined by:

- Overall creativity and innovation put into the Application; adding components beyond what was taught in the lab will earn you extra points, submitting an Application very similar to the example Application made during the lab will cost you points.
- Formulation of a fitting and clear research question.
- Your exploration and preprocessing of the data, including the handling of missing values, and selection of variables.
- Quality and appropriateness of the data visualizations created within the RShiny Application.
- Your understanding and appropriate use of different RShiny Interactive Components.
- Quality, appropriateness, and presentation of statistical techniques used relating to your dataset.
- Quality and appropriateness of the interpretation of the analysis results and its reactive component.
- The quality of your R code (i.e., clear structure and in accordance with Hadley Wickham's guidance).
- Overall quality of the Application (i.e., layout, title and description, stand-alone) and its usability.
